"TurfGuardian" is a strong and suitable project title for a football ground booking system that uses blockchain and NFT technology. It effectively conveys the idea of safeguarding or protecting the football turf while also implying a sense of trust and security, which is essential for a booking platform. Additionally, the title has a professional and authoritative tone, making it sound reliable and dependable.
Using ERC-721 tokens for football ground booking purposes is an interesting idea that leverages the benefits of blockchain technology for ensuring transparency and preventing disputes.

Advantages:

- Transparency: ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that can represent unique assets or access rights. By minting tokens for specific time slots, a transparent and verifiable record of who has booked the ground is created.
- Immutable Record: The blockchain's immutability ensures that once a booking is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This minimizes the risk of disputes.
- Ownership: Users who purchase these tokens have ownership over the booking time slots, reducing the potential for double bookings or disputes over availability.
- Smart Contracts: You can use smart contracts to automate the booking process. When users buy a token, the contract can automatically update the booking status and handle payments.
